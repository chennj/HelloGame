you guys have to realize just how big of a project this is but anyway because that would kind of be boring and I also have to kind of balance the entertainment versus production kind of balance I guess of this entire series. we're actually gonna dive in and start writing code like today and then as things creep up we're gonna plan for them then and there and because of that because that kind of iterative model that we're gonna do hopefully we'll get stuff actually happening as soon as possible and that way you guys will kind of see results and it'll be more entertaining but also it's a really good web development that personally also really like because instead of just kind of spending ages building up the older kind of foundation and then like a year later seeing a triangle on the screen we kind of get to we're able to get to that stage a lot faster and this is just kind of it's better to see if what we're doing is even going to work in the first place and then we can always kind of improve it anyway without much further ado um I was spending this entire week kind of planning this series and that's why I kind of just realized exactly how much is involved here and there's a bunch of like opinions that I really want to share with you guys in probably the coming weeks because the way that we do this is going to kind of impact the series because we either see something on the screen quickly or we wait longer and then get benefits further down the line but anyway again I don't want to talk about planning today so that's just kind of just some loose things on my mind today we're gonna set up everything so we're going to set up a github repository we're going to set up a visual studio solution and projects we're going to set up the configuration for that to some extent and we're going to just kind of link those two link everything together and make a simple obligation that prints hello world to the screen but it will be kind of structured and configuration correctly for our actual game engine
